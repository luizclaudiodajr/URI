You should make a program that reads any value and displays a message saying which of the following ranges ([0.25], (25,50], (50,75], (75.100]) this value is. Obviously if the value is not in any of these intervals should print the message "Out of range".

The symbol (is "greater than." For example:
[0.25] indicates values between 0 and 25.0000 including them.
(25,50] indicates values greater than 25 Ex: 25.00001 up the value 50.0000000
