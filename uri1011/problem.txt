Make a program that will calculate and show the volume of a sphere being provided the value of its radius (R).
The formula to calculate volume is: (4/3) * pi * R3. 
Consider (assign) to the value of pi 3.14159.

Tip: When using the formula, try to use (4 / 3.0) or (4.0 / 3), for some languages (among them the C ++), assume that the result of the division of two integers is another integer.

Entrance

The input file contains an integer value corresponding to the radius of the sphere.

Output

The output should be a "VOLUME" message as the example provided below, with a space before and a space after equality. The value should be presented with three places after the point.
