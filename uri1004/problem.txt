Read 2 floating point double precision values A and B, corresponding to two notes of a student. Next, calculate the average student, knowing that the note has weight 3.5 and the grade B has a weight of 7.5 (the sum of the weights so it's 11). Assume that each note can go from 0 to 10.0, always with one decimal place.

Entrance

The input file contains two values to one decimal place each.

Output

Calculate and print the variable MEDIA as the following example, with 5 digits after the decimal point and a blank space before and after equality. Use double-precision variables (double) and like all problems, be sure to print the finish line after the result, otherwise you will receive "Presentation Error".
